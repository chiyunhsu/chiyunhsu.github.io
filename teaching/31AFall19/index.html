    <p><b>Homework</b><br>
      Homework will be posted the night before each class, and is due at the beginning of the the next class.
      If you miss a class, you are still responsible for handing in the homework on time, either by asking a classmate to hand it in for you, or by sending an email to the grader (cc'ing me) with a clear photo or scan of your assignment.
      To be fair to other students and to graders, late homework will NOT be accepted.
      The lowest homework score will be dropped.
      <br><br>
      You are encouraged to discuss the problems with other students.
      However, you must write up the solutions on your own, as writing helps you probe and deepen your understanding.
      Apart from help from me or the TAs, you must acknowledge any collaborators or cite references at the top of your assignement.
