    <span class="title">The Geometry of Hilbert Schemes of Points on a Surface</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	In this talk, we will discuss some of the elementary properties of Hilbert schemes of points on a surface, with particular attention to the Hilbert scheme of points in <b>P</b><sup>2</sup>.  After defining the Hilbert scheme, some of the topics to be covered are smoothness, irreducibility, divisor and curve classes, and some elementary intersection calculations.  Time permitting, we will discuss some further properties of divisor classes, such as ampleness, effectiveness, and the corresponding birational models.
      </span>
      <span>
	This is a pretalk for the AGS talk on Tuesday, where after briefly mentioning the topics in the preceding paragraph we will spend most of the time discussing the problem of determining the cone of effective divisors. It is my goal that the seminar talk will be understandable for algebraic geometry grad students who either attend the pretalk or are familiar with the material it contains.

  <span class="title">The Geometry of the Horrocks-Mumford Bundle</span>
  <span class="abstract">
    <span>
      The Horrocks-Mumford bundle is the (almost) unique indecomposable rank 2 vector bundle on projective 4-space, but this description doesn't do it justice. It is one of those objects, like the lines on a cubic surface, which seems at first to be only of passing interest, but proves upon closer inspection to be incredibly rich. In this talk, we will construct the bundle, describe some of its properties, and see some of its connections to abelian surfaces and modular curves.

  <span class="title">Alternate Compactifications of Hurwitz Spaces</span>
  <span class="abstract">
    <span>
      Moduli spaces of geometrically interesting objects are usually not compact. They need to be compactified by allowing certain carefully chosen degenerations. Often, this can be done in several ways, leading to different birational models that are related in interesting ways. I will describe a range of compactifications of the Hurwitz space <i>H<sup>d</sup><sub>g</sub></i>, which parametrizes <i>d</i> sheeted, simply branched, genus <i>g</i> covers of the projective line. These compactifications are constructed by allowing degenererations where the branch points can collide in a prescribed way, recovering as a particular case the standard compactification by admissible covers.
    </span>
    <span>
	After the general construction, I will focus on the case of <i> d = 3</i>. In this case, the above construction gives a sequence of compactifications which contract the boundary divisors in the admissible cover compactification. I will construct a sequence of yet more compactifications that modify the interior, featuring the classical Maroni invariant of trigonal curves.

  <span class="title">Hilbert's Fourteenth Problem and Finite Generation of Section Rings</span>
  <span class="abstract">
    <span>
    Hilbert's fourteenth problem asks the following: let <i>k</i> be a field
and <i>K</i> a subfield of <i>k(x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>)</i>.  Must the ring <i>R = K &cap; k[x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>]</i> be finitely generated?  I will explain why Hilbert conjectured this might be true, how Zariski reinterpreted it as a question about finite generation of section rings <i>&oplus;<sub>k &ge; 0</sub> H<sup>0</sup>(X, O<sub>X</sub>(kD))</i> of line bundles, and how this perspective helps us see that it is false.  I'll mention some criteria for such section rings to be finitely generated, including a necessary and sufficient condition when <i>dim X = 2</i> and <i>D</i> is big.

  <span class="title"> A natural stratification of the moduli space of G-bundles on a curve</span>
  <span class="abstract">
    <span>
     We give a proof of the existence and main properties of a natural stratification of the moduli space <i>Bun<sub>G</sub></i> of principal <i>G</i>-bundles on a curve using the Tannakian viewpoint and Drinfeld's compactifications. The open strata form precisely the locus of semistable <i>G</i>-bundles, and the other strata are given by certain variants of this notion. In the special case <i>G = Gl<sub>n</sub></i>, i.e., the moduli space of vector bundles on a curve, the strata can be obtained as the loci on which the numerical invariants of the Harder-Narasimhan flag are constant.

  <span class="title">Algebraic stacks</span>
  <span class="abstract">
    <span>
      Stacks are an important tool for studying moduli problems in algebraic geometry. Nevertheless, defining these objects can be quite lengthy and uninspiring. We will provide motivation leading towards the construction of algebraic stacks. Along the way we will encounter various other objects which are interesting in their own right such as sheaves on Grothendieck topologies and fibered categories.

    <span class="title">Closed Families of Smooth Space Curves</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	Families of curves are an important object of study in algebraic geometry.  Most closed (i.e. projective) families of curves contain at least some singular curves.  In this talk, we study closed families of curves which contain no singular curves.  In particular, we show that if W parameterizes a "nice" family of smooth, curves in <i><b>P</b><sup>n</sup></i>, then <i>dim(W) &lt; n</i>.

    <span class="title">Introduction to theta characteristics</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>We are going to define theta characteristics on smooth curves, and work out explicitly what they are in the genus 3 case. We will prove the really nice theorem that says that the parity of theta characteristics is invariant as they vary in families. Then we will state the Riemann-Mumford relation, and work out some more applications. If there is time, we can talk about what happens on singular curves.

    <span class = "abstract">
      <span>
	The McKay correspondence relates finite subgroups of <i>Sl(2, C)</i>, their representation graphs, and the resolution graphs of the corresponding rational surface singularities.  Each of these objects may be classified separately in terms of (affine) simply laced Dynkin diagrams.  We will discuss some proofs of these classifications and how they are related to each other.

    <span class="title"> Hodge Theory, vanishing theorems and a (false) conjecture of Kodaira</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	Algebraic geometry nowadays has developed a twofold approach to investigate its own world. On one hand, we want to classify as precisely as possible the objects we are interested in singularly; on the other hand, we want to use this information to understand how the various shapes interact in (nice) families.
      </span>
      <span>
	I will try to give an overview of some of the tools and ideas involved in this dichotomy, especially from the point of view of Hodge theory. I will try also to talk about a conjecture of Kodaira about deformations of a Kaehler manifold, which was disproved in 2005 by Claire Voisin.

<h4>Post-talks / pre-talks</h4>
<p>It may be a good idea to give a talk explaining the context or the importance of the results talked about in the <a href="http://math.mit.edu/seminars/ags/agsfall11/">Algebraic Geometry Seminar</a>. Alternatively, you can give a pre-talk to the next week's AGS talk.</p>
