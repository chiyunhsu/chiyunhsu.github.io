    <span class="title">The degree of the Severi variety</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	This will be a gentle introduction to the Severi variety and the technique introduced by Caporaso and Harris to compute its degree. We will motivate their approach by looking at the case of singular cubics, and then use it to work out a more interesting example.

    <span class="title">Kapranov's theorem on rational normal curves</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	It is classically known that there is only one twisted cubic passing through 6 general points in the projective space. What if we have only 5 points? Kapranov gives a beautiful description of the variety parametrizing such curves, in terms of the moduli space of abstract pointed curves. We will use this result to answer an easy enumerative problem involving a secancy condition.

    <span class="title">Noether's Theorem on the Cremona group of the Plane</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	Max Noether is generally credited with the theorem that the group of birational automorphisms of the complex projective plane is generated by projective linear transformations and Cremona involutions. Typical of nineteenth-century algebraic geometry, his proof was subjected to a slew of objections and emendations. We will discuss this theorem from the modern viewpoint of the Sarkisov program.

    <span class="title">The ADE classification and beyond</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	The aim of this talk will be to introduce rational double point singularities on surfaces and discuss various aspects of their classification. As time permits, we will motivate several related local-to-global questions about quotient singularities and talk about potential approaches.

    <span class="title">Birational geometry of the space of one-dimensional sheaves on the plane</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	Given a line bundle on a smooth plane curve, we can push it forward and think of it as a sheaf in the plane. In this talk we will see how this idea allows us to construct a natural compactification of the relative Jacobian of the universal plane curve. We will then study some aspects of the divisor theory of these spaces.

    <span class="title">Weierstrass points</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	A smooth algebraic curve of genus g has a finite number of special points, called Weierstrass points, which are those points P such that the divisor g \cdot P moves in a pencil. Each Weierstrass point determines a numerical semigroup. I will discuss some recent results on the inverse problem: given a numerical semigroup, how large is the space of pointed curves corresponding to Weierstrass points with that semigroup? Time permitting, I will discuss some related problems in Brill-Noether theory.

    <span class="title">Subvarieties of hypersurfaces of moderately high degree</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	In this talk we'll discuss which varieties can be subvarieties of hypersurfaces of moderately high degree.  For instance, a general hypersurface of degree at least 2n-2 contains no rational curves. We discuss some results of Ein and Voisin generalizing this statement about rational curves.
