    <span class="title">Lines on Smooth Quadric Threefolds</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	In this talk, we show that the space of lines on a smooth quadric threefold is isomorphic to P^3.  The proof gives insight into the geometric structure of the grassmanian and the Plucker embedding.  Since this is one of the first talks of the year, we will try to keep things as down-to-earth as possible.

    <span class="title">Lefschetz Theory</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	We will start by proving the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and mention its applications. As time permits, we will also make some remarks on the Hard Lefschetz theorem and Picard-Lefschetz theory.

    <span class="title">T-Varieties and Deformations of Toric Varieties </span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	The definition of a T-varety is the same as that of a toric variety, except that the dimension of the torus may be less than the dimension of the variety. Motivated by the correspondences between the geometry of a toric variety and the combinatorics of its fan, we wish to translate properties of a T-variety into properties of the gadgets that classify them, called divisorial fans. In this talk, I will define these objects and explain how they can be applied to study deformations of toric varieties.

    <span class="title">How to use Spectral Sequences</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	Many people, when they first encounter spectral sequences, think of them as complicated pieces of homological algebra. In this talk, I aim to counter this misconception by showing how spectral sequences can be used in practical geometric settings. Examples will include an explanation for some of the qualitative differences between pushforward and higher direct images, and how to get information about the cohomology of sheaves on projective space from the minimal resolution.

    <span class="title">Algebraic and tropical curves</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
I will give a mostly expository talk introducing tropical geometry via the the study of tropical curves, and linear series on them, in relation to algebraic curves.  In particular, I will highlight recent developments in the subject by O. Amini, M. Baker, L. Caporaso, and others.
      
This talk is a practice talk for the AGNES conference, and if you come, you won't have to go to my AGNES talk at 9:00 on Sunday morning.

    <span class="title">Bertini's theorem for finite fields</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	A smooth projective variety X over a finite field need not have a smooth hyperplane section. However, for X fixed and d sufficiently large, there always exists a degree d hypersurface that meets X in a smooth subvariety. In fact, the probability that a randomly chosen degree d hypersurface meets X smoothly converges to a positive limit as d grows. I will describe Bjorn Poonen's proof of this fact via the so-called closed point sieve, and discuss several generalizations and applications. This talk will be a slightly modified version of the talk I gave at STAGE earlier this semester.

    <span class="title">Noether-Lefschetz theorem</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	We'll use deformation theory to prove the Noether-Lefschetz theorem: on a very general surface in P^3 of degree >=4, every curve is a complete intersection.

      <span>
	The talk will focus on understanding the kind of singularities that are involved in the study of the Minimal Model Program, Moreover, we will try to suggest some applications of these notions.

    <span class="title">Lazic's approach to the MMP</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	I will say a bit about Lazic's "new outlook" on the MMP, without assuming you already know about the other outlook.  In particular, I'll explain how if you're willing to take a result about finite generation of adjoint rings on faith, the basic tools needed to run the MMP (i.e. the cone and contraction theorems) become quite natural and easy to prove.  Then I'll discuss how the MMP for Mori Dream Spaces can be understood within the same framework.
