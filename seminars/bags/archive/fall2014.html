    <span class="title">Rational Curves on Hypersurfaces</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
  Let <i>X</i> be a general degree <i>d</i> hypersurface in <i>n</i>-dimensional projective space, and consider the spaces of rational curves on <i>X</i>. Joint with David Yang, following work of Harris, Roth, Starr, Beheshti and Kumar, we prove that the space of degree <i>e</i> rational curves on <i>X</i> is irreducible and we compute its dimension for <i>n > d+1</i>. This resolves all but the <i>n = d+1</i> case of a conjecture of Coskun, Harris and Starr.

    <span class="title"> Spherical varieties </span>
    <span class="abstract"> 
      <span>
Spherical varieties are a nice generalization of toric varieties, obtained starting from any reductive group instead of just the torus action. In particular, in this case also there is a complete classification of equivariant embeddings. I will give many examples, and if time permits I will discuss some details about this classification, obtained using colored fans.

In this talk I will focus on compactifying the parameter space of smooth quadric hypersurfaces in projective space using tools from the Minimal Model Program. Borrowing ideas from this case, I will also discuss different "possible" compactifications for the Hilbert scheme of curves in projective 3-space.

    <span class="title">Counting Rational Curves </span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
The goal of this talk is to discuss a paper of Gathmann which
gives a very concrete, yet powerful algorithm for counting rational curves
on varieties. In the first part of the talk I will very briefly review the
necessary background on quantum cohomology and enumerative geometry. The
emphasis will be on the underlying geometric ideas rather than the
structures themselves.

    <span class="title">Interpolation and vector bundles on curves</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
We aim to address the following: When is there a (smooth) curve of degree <i>d</i> and genus <i>g</i> passing through <i>n</i> general points in <i><b>P</b><sup>r</sup></i>. Generalizations ask for the dimension of the space of such curves, or replace the point incidence conditions with incidence to higher dimensional linear spaces. We will start by relating these statements to a property of the normal bundle of curves in projective space. Next, we will show how to address these questions for <i>r = 3</i> and <i>d &ge; g + 3</i>. The demonstrated techniques generalize significantly and lead to an answer to our question for <i>d &ge; g + r</i>. This is joint work with E. Larson and D. Yang.

    <span class="title">The Intersection of a General Space Curve with a Quadric</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
Let $C$ be a general curve of genus $g$, embedded in $\mathbb{P}^3$ via a general linear series of degree $d$. In this talk, we study the intersection $C\cap Q$ with a quadric hypersurface $Q\subset\mathbb{P}^3$; our goal is to understand this intersection in terms of the intrinsic geometry of $Q\simeq\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. The focus of the talk will be on several examples where exceptional phenomena occur; namely [(d,g)=(4,1),(5,2),(6,2),(6,4),(7,5),\text{ and }(8,6).] At the end, we will give a (very) brief sketch of a proof that in all other cases, the intersection is a general collection of $2d$ points in $Q$.

    <span class="title">Dynamics on the Moduli Space</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
Consider a Hodge bundle $\Omega \mathcal{M}_g$ of holomorphic
differentials over the moduli space of genus $g$ complex curves.
There is a natural action of the group $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ 
on the total space of this bundle, which gives the subject a dynamical flavor.
One possible question is: what are the closure of the orbits of this action
and what are their projections to the moduli space?
A. Eskin, M. Mirzakhani, and A. Mohammadi proved that they are always
algebraic subvarieties.
In genus 2, C. McMullen showed that the projections to the 
$\mathcal{M}_2$ are all familiar objects, 
such as isometrically immersed complex curves or Hilbert modular sufaces.
In the talk we will define the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ action and 
show the classification of the closure of the orbits in genus 2.

<h3>Pretalks</h3>
<p>  We can have <em>pretalks</em> for the <a href="http://math.harvard.edu/ags/">algebraic geometry seminar</a>. That is, talks explaining the background material for the talk in the main seminar. This is immensely helpful. If you see a talk lined up in the main seminar about something dear to you, do consider giving a pretalk.</p>
