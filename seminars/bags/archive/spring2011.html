      <a href="#abs" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a>
      <span>In his thesis, Lascoux described the minimal free resolutions of determinantal ideals over a field of characteristic 0. The main ingredient of his work is the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem. In my talk, I will try to give some working knowledge of the representation theory of GL<sub>n</sub> and the BWB theorem, as well as how to fit it together to get Lascoux's result. I'll also say something about what happens in positive characteristic.</span>

    <span class="title">Multiplication on <b>P</b><sup>1</sup>, vector bundles, Hilbert schemes of points, and the golden ratio</span>
    <span class="abstract hidden">
      <a href="#abstract" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a>
      <span>Consider the following basic problem about multiplication of polynomials in one variable.  Fix a general 3-dimensional space V of polynomials of degree a, and fix a second degree b.  Given a subspace W of the polynomials of degree b, think of W as occupying the fraction dim(W)/(b+1) of the space of polynomials of degree b.  For every such subspace W, does the product VW occupy at least as large a fraction of the polynomials of degree a+b as W does of the polynomials of degree b? That is, does multiplication by V always increase the fraction of the space occupied by W?</span>

      <span>Surprisingly, the answer to this question is connected to the golden ratio and its continued fraction expansion.  We will further discuss how this question is connected with semistability and splitting properties of certain particularly nice vector bundles on <b>P</b><sup>2</sup>, known as Steiner bundles.  These bundles can be viewed as natural generalizations of the tangent bundle.  Finally, we will discuss how these bundles give rise to extremal effective divisors on the Hilbert scheme of points in <b>P</b><sup>2</sup>.</span>

      <span>No prior knowledge of any of the topics in the second paragraph will be assumed.  Knowledge of polynomials in one variable will be helpful.</span>

      <span>
	Classical algebraic geometers believed that all singular curves could be obtained as limits of smooth curves. Mumford constructed extremely elegant counterexamples to this belief. His construction is based on an idea of Iarrobino, who had produced zero dimensional schemes that are not limits of smooth zero dimensional schemes. I will describe Iarrobino's and Mumford's examples.

    <span class="title"> The fundamental group of the complement of a curve in <b>P</b><sup>2</sup></span>

      <a href="#abstract" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a>
      <span>
	The Riemann Existence Theorem allows one to construct a degree <i>d</i> branched cover of <b>P</b><sup>1</sup> with prescribed branch points <i>b<sub>i</sub></i> and substitutions <i>s<sub>i</sub></i> in the symmetric group on <i>d</i> letters, provided that the product of all the substitutions is 1. This comes from knowing that the fundamental group of <b>P</b><sup>1</sup> with <i>n</i> points deleted is generated by <i>n</i> elements <i>g<sub>1</sub>, ..., g<sub>n</sub></i> with the only relation <i>g<sub>1</sub>...g<sub>n</sub></i> = 1.
	</span>
      <span>
	Therefore, in order to fully understand the existence of covers of <b>P</b><sup>2</sup>, one must understand the fundamental groups of the complements of curves (the branch curves) in <b>P</b><sup>2</sup>.  In this talk I will compute some of these fundamental groups, following Zariski, thereby illustrating the hidden richness of this problem.

      <span>
	Let <i>k</i> be a field and <i>I</i> &sub; <i>k</i>[<i>x</i>] be an ideal. If we want to determine whether some <i>f</i>&isin; <i>k</i>[<i>x</i>] is contained in <i>I</i>, we can just use the fact that <i>I</i> is principal and apply the familiar division algorithm. However, things do not work so simply for an ideal in <i>k</i>[<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;, <i>x</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>].
      </span>
      <span>
	In this talk we will introduce Gr&ouml;bner bases, which have nice properties that give us a way to determine ideal membership. We will describe Buchberger's algorithm to produce a Gr&ouml;bner basis and discuss several applications, for example in the computation of syzygies.
      </span>
      <span>A single ideal can have many different Gr&ouml;bner bases resulting from different orderings put on monomials. We will discuss properties of different term orderings and a method for switching between their resulting Gr&ouml;bner bases. We will also discuss the complexity of ideal membership, bounds for the number and size of the generators of a Gr&ouml;bner bases for a given ideal.

    <span class="title">Proof of Pick's theorem using toric geometry</span>
    <span class="abstract hidden">
      <a href="#abstract" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a>
      <span>
	Toric geometry provides a quite different yet elementary way to see many examples and phenomena in algebraic geometry. Toric varieties correspond to objects much like the simplicial complexes studied in elementary topology, and all the basic concepts on toric varieties &mdash; maps between them, line bundles, cycles, etc. &mdash; correspond to simple notions. this makes everything much more computable and concrete than usual.
      </span>
      <span>
	In this talk, I will briefly explain basic definitions and theories in toric geometry, especially about line bundles on toric varieties. It is easy to observe that we can construct a lattice polytope corresponding to each line bundle, and by using this we are going to prove Pick's theorem which is the following: If <i>P</i> is a two-dimensional lattice polytope, and <i>i(P)</i> is the number of lattice points inside of <i>P</i> and <i>p(P)</i> is the number of lattice points on the perimeter of <i>P</i> , then we have  <i>i(P) = (Area of P) - p(P)/2 + 1</i>.
      </span>
      <span>
	Here you will see how toric geometers prove something which your 12-year-old
nephew can prove.

    <span class="title">Limit linear series</span>
    <span class="abstract hidden">
      <a href="#abstract" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a>
      <span>
      Many problems about smooth curves are most easily attacked by considering degeneration to singular curves, and understanding how the structure of nearby curves is reflected in the limit. I will describe the technique of limit linear series, developed and applied in a series of papers by Eisenbud and Harris, which provides a formalism for studying linear series on nearby smooth curves by describing an appropriate notion of the limit of these linear series. This technique gives simplified proofs of the Brill-Noether and Gieseker-Petri theorems, and can also be used to show that the moduli space of curves is of general type for sufficiently large genus. I will describe and motivate the main definitions and correspondence theorems, and give a proof of the Brill-Noether theorem. If time permits, I may comment on the relationship between limit linear series and more recent techniques from tropical geometry.

    <span class="title">Monodromy and elliptic surfaces</span>
    <span class="abstract hidden">
      <a href="#abstract" onclick="toggle(this.parentNode)">abstract&plusmn;</a>
      <span>
	Monodromy is a useful tool in many geometric applications, but it is a confusing word, because depending on the context it can have different meanings.  In this talk, I will explain what is probably the most common algebraic geometry use of the word monodromy, and use elliptic surfaces as a motivating example.  The monodromy of elliptic surfaces was an important ingredient in Kodaira's classification of compact analytic surfaces, and more generally, monodromy is a common tool in many different algebraic geometry problems.

Below are some ideas for talks. You may want to look at Izzet Coskun's <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~coskun/bagslist.pdf">list</a> (with lots of references) or Johan de Jong's <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~dejong/seminar/list_papers.html">seminar page</a> for more topics.

<h3>Pretalks</h3>
<p>Since we meet right before the <a href="http://math.mit.edu/seminars/ags/agsspring11/">algebraic geometry seminar</a>, we can have <em>pretalks</em> -- talks explaining the background material for the talk in the main seminar. This is immensely helpful. If you see a talk lined up in the main seminar about something dear to you, do consider giving a pretalk.</p>
