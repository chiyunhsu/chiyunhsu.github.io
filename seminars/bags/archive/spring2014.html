    <span class="title">The Bialynicki-Birula decomposition</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	<p>Given a variety with an action of the multiplicative group, a beautiful theorem of Bialynicki-Birula from 1973 gives us an affine stratification based on ``limits'' of orbits. It is indeed a very simple and powerful tool, and it can be seen as algebraic analogue of Morse theory. We will describe it, and give many consequences and examples.</p>

    <span class="title">Correspondences and the geometry of space curves</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	The origins of modern intersection theory can be traced back to Schubert calculus and the theory of correspondences. We will introduce correspondences and discuss some of their applications to geometry of space curves. Along the way, we will discuss several enumerative questions about trisecants such as counting the stationary trisecants, tangential trisecants, and quadrisecants.

    <span class="title">Schubert Calculus and Littlewood-Richardson Rules</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	A set of techniques used by Hermann Schubert in his study of enumerative questions in projective geometry during the mid 19th century became what is now know as Schebert calculus. The techniques are used for calculating cohomology classes in certain homogeneous spaces and in particular the Grassmannian. We will look at how these techniques work in the Grassmannian, and we will talk about the rules/algorithms that have arisen to help calculate the Littlewood-Richardson structure coefficients of the Chow ring of this space.

    <span class="title">Complete twisted cubics</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
Finding characteristic numbers of twisted cubics is a very old problem that can be traced back to Schubert's book "Kalkul der abzahlenden Geometrie" in 1879. Even though many solutions have been proposed since then, we still do not have a completely satisfactory moduli space, expecially when it comes to more intricate prroblems involving tangency or multisecancy conditions. Following the construction of wonderful compactifications by De Concini and Procesi, and taking as model the space of complete conics, we propose a new compactification of the space of twisted cubics; we will show some properties of this space, and discuss why this choice could lead to new characteristic numbers. If time permits, we will describe the geometry in codimension 1 and 2 of the boundary. This is the practice for a talk in Zurich on Friday.

    <span class="title">Mumford-Tate groups</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	Mumford-Tate groups are the basic symmetry groups of Hodge theory. I will define these groups and discuss some of their applications, e.g. to the Hodge conjecture and to obstructing Hodge structures of certain varieties from "coming from" abelian varieties.

    <span class="title">Rational curves on hypersurfaces</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	On a general hypersurface of degree d in P^n, we expect the dimension of the space of degree e rational curves to be e(n-d+1)+n-4. I will first outline the problem and explain why the expected dimension is reasonable. Then, I will do a ``low-tech'' treatment of some example cases, trying to give an idea of the techniques involved. Finally, I will sketch the proof that the expected dimension equals the actual dimension for n>=d+2.

    <span class="title">Complements of plane curves and their fundamental groups</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	The problem of computing fundamental groups of plane curve complements has a very rich history. We will motivate the problem and discuss some of the approaches for computing pi_1. The focus of our discussion will be a statement by Zariski that the complement of a nodal curve has abelian pi_1. We will present Zariski's original proof which is based on a theorem by Severi (which remains open), and later complete proofs by Abhyankar-Fulton-Hansen-Deligne.

    <span class="title">The Luroth Problem</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
The most basic birational class of varieties are the rational ones. In practice, though, it is often much easier to show that a variety is dominated by a rational variety. It is therefore natural to ask what the difference is between the class of unirational and rational varieties. For curves, there is no difference. For complex surfaces, there is no difference. Over finite fields, and in higher dimensions, there is a distinction. I will discuss some of the methods used to prove irrationality of unirational varieties.

    <span class="title">An overview of Log Geometry</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	<p>I will attempt to do the impossible: I will do some *very* basic concrete examples to get the feel of what log structures are, then give an overview of the usefulness of the language of log geometry in various contexts, all while knowing little about log geometry. Should be a heckler's paradise.</p>
