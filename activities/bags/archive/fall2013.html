      <span>
	In this talk I will describe various examples of moduli spaces of sheaves and I will talk about some of the techniques that are used to study them.

    <span class="title">Brill-Noether theory in low codimension</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
Brill-Noether theory studies the existence and deformations of curves in
projective spaces; its basic object of study is W(g,r,d), the moduli
space of smooth projective genus g curves with a choice of degree d line
bundle having at least (r+1) independent global sections. The geometry
of W(g,r,d) is depends on the number ÃÂ = g-(r+1)(g-d+r). The
Brill-Noether theorem, proved by Griffiths and Harris, states that when
ÃÂ is nonnegative, the map from W(g,r,d) to M_g is surjective, and a
general fiber has dimension ÃÂ. One may naturally conjecture that for
ÃÂ<0, W(g,r,d) is finite over a locus of codimension -ÃÂ in M_g. This
conjecture fails, but seemingly only when ÃÂ is large compared to g. I
will discuss a proof that this conjecture holds for at least one
component of W(g,r,d) in cases where 0 < -ÃÂ < r/(r+2) g - 3r. The proof
relies on smoothing chains of elliptic curves, each joined to its
neighbors at two points differing by a carefully chosen order of
torsion.

      <span>
	We will study the Hurwitz space parametrizing simply ramified covers of a fixed curve X. We will review the classical results where X is rational, and ask the analogous questions for higher genus curves X.

    <span class="title">Rational points on elliptic curves and geometry of Shimura curves</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	We begin by describing an explicit 2-descent result on a certain class of elliptic curves E over Q, which together with the famous conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, predicts that E should have algebraic rank one. Motivated by a conjectural construction of a rational point of infinite order on E, we are led to study Heegner points on certain Shimura curves. We will try to explain how to construct various explicit models of such a Shimura curve, exhibit their beautiful geometry and deduce arithmetic consequences as well.

    <span class="title">Rational Curves on Hypersurfaces</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	This talk will be about the results of Harris, Roth, and Starr on the dimension of rational curves in hypersurfaces of large dimension.  I will start by describing the question, talking about what the expected answer is, why the question is hard, and give a couple of simple examples.  Then, I will state their result, and sketch the technique that they use to prove it.

    <span class="title">Smoothing algebraic space curves</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	The aim of this talk will be to explore the following question: Which singular curves in P^3 occur as limits of smooth ones? While a complete classification is too much to ask for, we will provide some answers for particular nodal curves. The topic provides a practical environment to learn about deformation theory and elementary transformations of vector bundles.

    <span class="title">The moduli spaces of stable pairs</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	Let X be a projective variety, E_0 a fixed coherent sheaf on X. We would to parametrize morphisms E_0 --> E of coherent sheaves. Before doing this, we need to introduce semistability conditions. By relating these to GIT semistability conditions, we are able to construct the moduli space parametrizing these semistable objects, via GIT. In the talk, you will see the general idea to construct a moduli space via the geometric invariant theory. This is work in progress.

    <span class="title">The Cone Conjecture</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
	If X is a Fano variety, then the cone of curves NE(X) is a rational polyhedral cone.  In the "next" case, X Calabi-Yau, this need not be the case, but the Kawamata-Morrison cone conjecture predicts that even if the cone isn't rational polyhedral, it's given by translates of some rational polyhedral subcone under automorphisms of X.  I'll give some examples and sketch the proof in dimension 2, mostly following a couple papers by Totaro.
