    <span class="title">An Adelic Approach to Riemann-Roch Theorem for Curves over Finite Fields</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
For curves defined over finite fields, 
we present a proof for the Riemann-Roch theorem
focusing on the their function fields. 
Using the correspondence between adeles and divisors, 
the Riemann-Roch Theorem is a reinterpretation of the self-duality 
of the locally compact additive group of the Adele ring. 
The reference for the talk is A. Weil, Basic Number Theory, chap. VI.

    <span class="title">Invariants of branched covers of P^1</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
A branched cover is a (non-constant) holomorphic map from a smooth irreducible curve C to P^1. If you have spent some time with Anand, you may have heard of some natural vector bundles one can associate to a branched cover. In this talk we will define these vector bundles, and compute their splitting types in some of the known cases.
Depending on how far we get, we may also talk about balanced bundles on a chain of rational curves, and a specific version of the maximal rank problem that arises from these computations.

    <span class="title">Degenerations of Castelnuovo curves in projective 3-space</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
In this talk, we'll study the following classical question: In what ways can a smooth non-degenerate curve in projective 3-space degenerate to a singular, reducible or non-reduced curve? and as it degenerates, what is the behavior of the defining equations? 
I will present a partial answer to this question for the case of Castelnuovo curves. All the necessary definitions and conventions will be presented.

    <span class="title">3264, again?!</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
How many plane conics are tangent to 5 general conics? Looking back in my 4 years of graduate school, I believe I have explored all possible ways to answer to this question. Still, in this talk I am going to present a different one, using tools from representation theory to deal with the intersection theory of the space of complete conics. As Joe says, the main point of enumerative geometry is not really to get numbers (even though you have to admit that 3264 is a pretty cool number); the aim is to learn how to use new tools, to apply elsewhere. In fact, if time permits, I will show how in my thesis I am trying to apply all of this to the study of the geometry of twisted cubics.

    <span class="title">N&eacuteron Models, Elliptic Surfaces, and ADE Singularities</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
The theory of N&eacuteron models explains how to extend an elliptic curve over the generic fiber of a discrete valuation ring to a relative curve over the whole discrete valuation ring.  The theory is useful to number theorists who can use it to talk about the reduction of an elliptic curve mod p and to algebraic geometers who can use it to give a canonical model of an elliptic surface.  The possible fibers are somewhat mysterious however, and the aim of this talk is to relate them to ADE singularities, which locally look like quotients of the plane by finite subgroups of SL<sub>2</sub>.

    <span class="title">Vector bundles on curves in g=0,1</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
The moduli of vector bundles on a curve is a fascinating mathematical object connected to algebraic geometery, differential geometry and low dimensional topology, but there are only a few cases where vector bundles are classified explicitly. The first nontrivial case (due to Grothendieck's splitting) is when the base curve is elliptic over an algebrically closed field, which was completely solved by Atiyah. This talk would give an overview of some of these classical results.

    <span class="title">Unirationality of high dimensional hypersurfaces</span>

      <span>
One important question in binational geometry is whether a given variety admits a rational map from P<sup>n</sup>. We present a result of Harris, Mazur and Pandharipande that shows that a smooth low degree hypersurface in very high dimension does admit such a rational map.

    <span class="title">Potential density of quartic threefolds</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
For curves, we know well that how many rational points are there depending on their genus. For surfaces, we have good idea about this problem via Enriques-Kodiara classification. Unfortunately, we do not have much idea for threefolds. Inspired from Lang's conjectures, I will discuss about potential density conjecture, which states that for any projective fano variety over a number field, we can choose some finite extension of that field to extract Zariski dense amount of rational points. This talk will focus on one nontrivial case of this conjecture, the quartic threefolds. I will draw some striking geometrical method used to prove arithmetic fact. The reference for the brilliant idea came from a paper by J. Harris and Y. Tschinkel called "Rational Points on Quartics"

    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
How many curves are there in P<sup>2</sup> of degree d and genus g
through 3d+g-1 general points?  Mathematicians have been trying to
answer this question for hundreds of years.  In the 90's, Caparaso and
Harris proved a recursive formula which provided a complete answer to
this question.  In this talk, I discuss a new approach to computing
Severi degrees of surfaces in terms of operators on an infinite
dimensional vector space.

    <span class="title">Specialization of quintic threefolds to the secant variety</span>
    <span class="abstract">
      <span>
We consider the degeneration of quintic threefolds obtained by
running semistable reduction on a general pencil of quintics specializing to the secant variety of a normal elliptic curve in projective 4-space. The question we would like to address is: what are the flat limits of the rational curves in this degeneration? In this talk, I will provide a good âfirst approximationâ to the answer by describing the space of genus zero stable morphisms to the central fiber (as defined by J. Li).
